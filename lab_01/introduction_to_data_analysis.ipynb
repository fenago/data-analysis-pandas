    "## Fundamentals of data analysis\n",
    "When conducting a data analysis, we will move back and forth between four main processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Collection**: Every analysis starts with collecting data. We can collect data from a variety of sources, including databases, APIs, flat files, and the Internet.\n",
    "- **Data Wrangling**: After we have our data, we need to prepare it for our analysis. This may involve reshaping it, changing data types, handling missing values, and/or aggregating it. \n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We can use visualizations to explore our data and summarize it. During this time, we will also begin exploring the data by looking at its structure, format, and summary statistics.\n",
    "- **Drawing Conclusions**: After we have thoroughly explored our data, we can try to draw conclusions or model it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical Foundations\n",
    "As this is not a statistics course, we will discuss the concepts we will need to work through the course, in addition to some avenues for further exploration. By no means is this exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling\n",
    "Some resampling (sampling from the sample) techniques we will see throughout the course, especially for the labs on machine learning (9-11):\n",
    "- **simple random sampling**: pick with a random number generator\n",
    "- **stratified random sampling**: randomly pick preserving the proportion of groups in the data\n",
    "- **bootstrapping**: sampling with replacement (more info: [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcPIyeqymOU) and [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "We use descriptive statistics to describe the data. The data we work with is usually a **sample** taken from the **population**. The statistics we will discuss here are referred to as **sample statistics** because they are calculated on the sample and can be used as estimators for the population parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measures of Center\n",
    "Three common ways to describe the central tendency of a distribution are mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "##### Mean\n",
    "The sample mean is an estimator for the population mean ($\\mu$) and is defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{1}^{n} x_i}{n}$$\n",
    "##### Median\n",
    "The median represents the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of our data; this means that 50% of the values are greater than the median and 50% are less than the median. It is calculated by taking the middle value from an ordered list of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mode\n",
    "The mode is the most common value in the data. We can use it to describe categorical data or, for continuous data, the shape of the distribution:"

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Measures of Spread\n",
    "Measures of spread tell us how the data is dispersed; this will indicate how thin (low dispersion) or wide (very spread out) our distribution is.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Range\n",
    "The range is the distance between the smallest value (minimum) and the largest value (maximum):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$range = max(X) - min(X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Variance\n",
    "The variance describes how far apart observations are spread out from their average value (the mean). When calculating the sample variance, we divide by *n - 1* instead of *n* to account for using the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is referred to as Bessel's correction and is applied to get an unbiased estimator of the population variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that this will be in units-squared of whatever was being measured.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Standard Deviation\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, giving us a measure in the same units as our data. The sample standard deviation is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n - 1}} = \\sqrt{s^2}$$"

    "*Note that $\\sigma^2$ is the population variance and $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Coefficient of Variation\n",
    "The coefficient of variation (CV) gives us a unitless ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. Since, it has no units we can compare dispersion across datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CV = \\frac{s}{\\bar{x}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interquartile Range\n",
    "The interquartile range (IQR) gives us the spread of data around the median and quantifies how much dispersion we have in the middle 50% of our distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Quartile Coefficient of Dispersion\n",
    "The quartile coefficient of dispersion also is a unitless statistic for comparing datasets. However, it uses the median as the measure of center. It is calculated by dividing the semi-quartile range (half the IQR) by the midhinge (midpoint between the first and third quartiles):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$QCD = \\frac{\\frac{Q_3 - Q_1}{2}}{\\frac{Q_1 + Q_3}{2}} = \\frac{Q_3 - Q_1}{Q_3 + Q_1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summarizing data\n",
    "The **5-number summary** provides 5 descriptive statistics that summarize our data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | Quartile | Statistic | Percentile |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "|1.|$Q_0$|minimum|$0^{th}$|\n",
    "|2.|$Q_1$|N/A|$25^{th}$|\n",
    "|3.|$Q_2$|median|$50^{th}$|\n",
    "|4.|$Q_3$|N/A|$75^{th}$|\n",
    "|5.|$Q_4$|maximum|$100^{th}$|\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary can be visualized using a **box plot** (also called box-and-whisker plot). The box has an upper bound of $Q_3$ and a lower bound of $Q_1$. The median will be a line somewhere in this box. The whiskers extend from the box towards the minimum/maximum. For our purposes, they will extend to $Q_3 + 1.5 \\times IQR$ and $Q_1 - 1.5 \\times IQR$ and anything beyond will be represented as individual points for outliers:"

    "#### Common Distributions\n",
    "- **Gaussian (normal) distribution**: looks like a bell curve and is parameterized by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). Many things in nature happen to follow the normal distribution, like heights. Note that testing if a distribution is normal is not trivial. Written as $N(\\mu, \\sigma)$.\n",
    "- **Poisson distribution**: discrete distribution that is often used to model arrivals. Parameterized by its mean, lambda (λ). Written as $Pois(\\lambda)$.\n",
    "- **Exponential distribution**: can be used to model the time between arrivals. Parameterized by its mean, lambda (λ). Written as $Exp(\\lambda)$.\n",
    "- **Uniform distribution**: places equal likelihood on each value within its bounds (*a* and *b*). We often use this for random number generation. Written as $U(a, b)$.\n",
    "- **Bernoulli distribution**: When we pick a random number to simulate a single success/failure outcome, it is called a Bernoulli trial. This is parameterized by the probability of success (*p*). Written as $Bernoulli(p)$.\n",
    "- **Binomial distribution**: When we run the same experiment *n* times, the total number of successes is then a binomial random variable. Written as $B(n, p)$.\n",

In order to help out the ice cream shop, though, we need to find a way to make predictions from this data. We can use a technique called **regression** to model the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales with an equation:"
   ]

If the temperature value we are using for prediction is within the range of the original data we used to build our regression model, then we are **interpolating** (solid portion of the red line). On the other hand, if the temperature is beyond the values in the original data, we are **extrapolating**, which is very dangerous, since we can't assume the pattern continues indefinitely in each direction (dotted portion of the line). Extremely hot temperatures may cause people to stay inside, meaning no ice creams will be sold, while the equation indicates record-high sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting is a type of prediction for time series. In a process called **time series decomposition**, time series is decomposed into a trend component, a seasonality component, and a cyclical component. These components can be combined in an additive or multiplicative fashion:"

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The **trend** component describes the behavior of the time series in the long-term without accounting for the seasonal or cyclical effects. Using the trend, we can make broad statements about the time series in the long-run, such as: *the population of Earth is increasing* or *the value of a stock is stagnating*. **Seasonality** of a time series explains the systematic and calendar-related movements of a time series. For example, the number of ice cream trucks on the streets of New York City is high in the summer and drops to nothing in the winter; this pattern repeats every year regardless of whether the actual amount each summer is the same. Lastly, the **cyclical** component accounts for anything else unexplained or irregular with the time series; this could be something like a hurricane driving the number of ice cream trucks down in the short-term because it isn't safe to be outside. This component is difficult to anticipate with a forecast due to its unexpected nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "When making models to forecast time series, some common methods include ARIMA-family methods and exponential smoothing. **ARIMA** stands for autoregressive (AR), integrated (I), moving average (MA). Autoregressive models take advantage of the fact that an observation at time $t$ is correlated to a previous observation, for example at time $t - 1$. Note that not all time series are autoregressive. The integrated component concerns the differenced data, or the change in the data from one time to another. Lastly, the moving average component uses a sliding window to average the last $x$ observations where $x$ is the length of the sliding window. We will build an ARIMA model in lab 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "The moving average puts equal weight on each time period in the past involved in the calculation. In practice, this isn't always a realistic expectation of our data. Sometimes all past values are important, but they vary in their influence on future data points. For these cases, we can use exponential smoothing, which allows us to put more weight on more recent values and less weight on values further away from what we are predicting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inferential Statistics\n",
    "Inferential statistics deals with inferring or deducing things from the sample data we have in order to make statements about the population as a whole. Before doing so, we need to know whether we conducted an observational study or an experiment. An observational study can't be used to determine causation because we can't control for everything. An experiment on the other hand is controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the sample statistics we discussed earlier are estimators for the population parameters. Our estimators need **confidence intervals**, which provide a point estimate and a margin of error around it. This is the range that the true population parameter will be in at a certain **confidence level**. At the 95% confidence level, 95% of the confidence intervals calculated from random samples of the population contain the true population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have the option of using **hypothesis testing**. First, we define a null hypothesis (say the true population mean is 0), then we determine a **significance level** (1 - confidence level), which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. Our result is statistically significant if the value for the null hypothesis is outside the confidence interval.
